# data-cleaning-covid19

DISCLAIMER : 
I'm not a data scientist in professional, I'm an analyst in engineering field. This is my first data cleaning implementation on COVID19 Vaccination Data. If any works that might mislead or incorrect, please tell me the incorrect informations and what would be the best fit to the incorrect one. Thankyou

This project shows you how to clean the data that I found in Kaggle Dataset. It's a simple implementation on how to perform HANDLING MISSING VALUES which is crucial pre-processing procedure. I would try to implement other pre-processing procedure on this dataset such as Scaling and/ Normalization, handle outlier data, etc.

This is the step that I did on COVID19 Vaccination Dataset:
1. Exploring into the data
    We need to take a brief look at the dataset that we collect to get a better understanding about the data. I tried to figure out the size, description, any columns that exist in the dataset.
2.  After we know what this dataset tells us about, then we can perform Handling Missing Values procedures. In this code, I performed two ways on how to fill the missing values, there are drop the rows/columns and fill the missing values with the data-pattern that I found in the column.

All the details analytics and action performing 'Handling Missing Values' is in the other files
